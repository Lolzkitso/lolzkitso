# About me
Hey, I'm lolzkitso, or just kitso, and I am a small Roblox content maker.
I mostly post small builds on Roblox, mods for Minecraft and Stardew Valley and/or Plugins if I have time.

- Iâ€™m currently learning CSS and LUA.
- How to reach me: You can contact me on Pinterest if you have any concerns or questions on my work, or if you just
 wanna talk, that works too! :D

- Pronouns: They/Them

# What Am I Working On Right Now?
I am working on a Game for Roblox at the moment, no idea on when it releases lol
